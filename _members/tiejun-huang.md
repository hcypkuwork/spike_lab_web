Professor Panagiotis Angeloudis is the Director of the [Transport Systems and Logistics Laboratory](https://transport-systems.imperial.ac.uk), based in the [Centre for Transport Engineering & Modelling](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/transport-engineering) at [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk). He is also a Turing Fellow with the [Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk).


His research focuses on the intersection of autonomous systems, multi-agent modelling and network optimisation and their applications to freight distribution and passenger transportation. His research group specialises in developing high-performance, scalable models that capture the interactions between users, providers, infrastructure and operating regimes. Recent TSL projects have focused on the design of deployment strategies for safe and efficient autonomous transport systems (AVs, drones) for passenger and freight mobility.  

Panagiotis was recently appointed by the UK Department for Transport to the Expert Panel for Maritime 2050 and has been a member of the Future of Mobility review team for the UK Government Office of Science. Over the years, he has advised and developed bespoke models for major corporations, government agencies and consultancies worldwide on initiatives related to transport infrastructure, operations management and technology deployment.

At Imperial, he leads a team of over 15 researchers, and is also the Programme Director of the [MSc in Transport and Data Science](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/study/courses/postgraduate-taught/transport-data-science/). He has a broad portfolio of funded research projects, with significant support from EPSRC, InnovateUK, the UK and foreign governments, and the industry. He is a member of the management committee for the [Imperial Robotics Forum](http://www.imperial.ac.uk/robotics/), Director of Teaching for the Transport Section, and transport champion for the [Institute for Security Science and Technology](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/security-institute/).

He is an Associate Editor of the Journal of Maritime Policy and Management and a member of the United States Transportation Research Board Committee on Ports and Channels. -->
